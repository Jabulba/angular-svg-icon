# About eye.svg
The eye.svg is modified to remove the height and width attributes from the file 
per Sara Soueidan's advice in "[Making SVGs Responsive With 
CSS](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/08/19/making-svgs-responsive-with-css/)".

> In order to make an SVG fluid, the first logical thing to do is to remove the 
> height and width attributes. When a fixed height and/or width is specified, 
> the SVG is going to maintain that height/or width, thus restricting it from 
> being fully responsive. You should, however, leave the viewBox attribute 
> present. After removing the height and width, you can embed the SVG in one of 
> several ways on the page.
